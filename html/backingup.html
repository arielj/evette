<h1 align=center><u>Backing Up</u></h1>

<p>
At the moment the backing up of your data is down to you. There are mysql tools available to backup up and restore your data. If you need help let me know and I will try to put together a guide to backing up.

<font size=5 color=red><b>MAKE SURE THAT YOU BACK YOUR DATA UP REGULARLY!</b></font><br><br>
Evette is designed to be as reliable as possible but bear in mind that hard disks can fail at any time, lightening could strike, you could get flooded (I speak from experience), a heard of elephants could stampede through your offices, you could fall victim to burglars, vandals, arsonists, squatters or aliens. <font color=red><b>You have been warned!</b></font>
