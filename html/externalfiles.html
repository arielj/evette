<h1 align=center><u>External Files</u></h1>

<p>
There are many possible reasons for wanting to attach an external file to an Evette record:
</p>
<br><br>
<ul>
	<li>vet records from an animals previous vet</li>
	<li>test results back from the lab</li>
	<li>a photograph of an animal</li>
	<li>Copies of letters sent to clients</li>
</ul>

<a name=attaching><h2>Attaching Files</h2>

<p>
With Evette this is made very simple. Simply open the client or animal record that you want to attach the file to. Go to it's <b>Attached Files</b> tab and click on the <b>Add New External File</b> button. You will be prompted to choose a file from your local filesystem. It's as easy as that. You can also, should you want to, give a brief description of the file you are attaching, sometimes the filenames themselves do not indicate very clearly what they contain. You can either fill in the description box before attaching file or one attached, highlight the file, fill in the description and click on the <b>Update Description</b> button.
</p>

<p>
So you can attach any kind of file to a record. What do you do if you want to use or view that file now that it has been attached? Because Evette is designed to run on various different operating systems, I have left it up to the user to tell Evette which programs they would like to use to open attached files.
</p>

<p>
<u>Note:</u><br>
You file associations are stored locally on the machine running the Evette client NOT centrally on the database. This way different machines on your network can have different file associations.
</p>

<p>
You can create or edit your file associations by choosing <b>File Associations</b> from the <b>Settings</b> menu:
</p>

<p>
For example, if I want Evette to open all html files with Mozilla Firefox. I would put "html" in the "Extension" input and the path to Firefox - "C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe" in the "Progam" input. Easy.
