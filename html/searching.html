<a name=clientsandanimals><h2>Clients and Animals</h2>

<p>
For evette1.1 I have introduced a much more powerful (but more complicated - sorry) search tool for clients and animals:
</p>

<p align=center><img src=images/searchpanel.jpg></p>

<p>
In previous versions of evette, the only way to find a particular animal was to know the owners details. Using this new search tool it is possible to find an animal even if you do not know who owns it.
</p>

<p>
Simply fill in details that you know and hit the search button.
</p>

<p>
<u>Note:</u><br>
<b>You do NOT need to fill in all of these fields!</b> The fastest way to find a client/animal is to put in the owners surname and/or postcode. If you do not know these, you can attempt to find narrow down the possibilities using the other fields available.
</p>

<a name=appointments><h2>Appointments</h2>

<p>
Should you want to view all appointments in a certain time frame. Choose <b>Appointment Search</b> from the <b>Appointment</b> menu or to browse appointments on a calendar choose <b>Browse Appointments</b> from the <b>Appointment</b> menu.
