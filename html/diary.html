<h1 align=center><u>The Diary</u></h1>

<p>
To help incourage a paperless (or slightly less paper) office, Evette has a built in diary. You can use this tool to quickly leave yourself, a colleague or everyone a message or reminder. I thought of a number of different ways to handle the diary and opted for a slightly less logical but more user friendly system. It is easiest to explain with examples.
</p>

<a name=creating><h2>Creating Diary Notes</h2>

<p>
The quickest way to create a diary note is to choose <b>Add to Diary</b> from the <b>Diary</b> menu. This will give you this panel:
</p>

<p align=center>
<img src=images/newdiarynote.jpg>
</p>

<p>
Here you can specify:
</p>

<dl>
	<dt><b><font color=blue>Date</font></b></dt><dd>The date that you would like the note to become active</dd>
	
	<dt><b><font color=blue>Username and Position</font></b></dt><dd>This is a little complicated. If you would like your diary note to be for the attention of everybody, leave these fields blank. If you would like this note to be for the attention of a particular user enter the username here (or choose it from the associated drop down). If you would like the note to be for the attention of a particular group of staff, for example managers, vets, receptionists etc.. then enter their position here (or choose it from the associated drop down).</dd>
	
	<dt><b><font color=blue>Subject</font></b></dt><dd>Enter a (very) brief description of the notes contents here.</dd>
	
	<dt><b><font color=blue>Note</font></b></dt><dd>This is where you can write the body of your note.</dd>
	
	<dt><b><font color=blue>Removed</font></b></dt><dd>Leave this blank. When you want to remove the note from the diary, then put todays date in here.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
When you are happy with your note, click on the <b>Submit</b> button at the bottom.
</p>

<a name=viewingandediting><h2>Viewing and Editing Diary Notes</h2>

<p>
You can view the diary by choosing <b>Edit Diary</b> from the <b>Diary</b> menu or by clicking on the <b>Edit Diary</b> tool bar button. This will bring up this panel:
</p>

<p align=center>
<img src=images/editdiarypanel.jpg>
</p>

<p>
At the top of this panel you will find a set of filters that you can use to adjust which diary notes are shown. If you leave them as they are, you will be shown all active diary notes addressed to you personally or addressed to your position or addressed to everybody. This is exactly what you are most likely to want to see. If however you wanted to view removed notes, notes addressed to other users or other positions or notes not yet active, you can adjust these filters to suit your needs.
</p>

<p>
The list of notes is shown in the large panel on the left. If you click on an item in this list the entire note will be displayed in the large panel to the right. To edit a note, select the note you would like to edit and click on the <b>Edit</b> button or just double click on the note. To delete a note, select the note you would like to delete and click on the <b>Delete</b> button (<u>Note:</u> this will permanently delete the note. If you want to mark a note as completed or removed, edit the note and put todays date in the <b>Removed</b> field. This will allow you to retrieve the note or check when it was removed and by who should you need to).
</p>

<a name=links><h2>Linking Diary Notes to Records</h2>

<p>
To save time. If you want to leave a note regarding a particular client, animal or appointment you can link the note to the record. This way when the note is viewed, the associated record is just a click away. To create a linked diary note. Open the client, animal or appointment that you want to link to, and click on the <b>Create Diary Note</b> button:
</p>

<p align=center>

</p>

<p>
Then fill in the note as normal. When viewed the note have a button which will take you to the associated record.
