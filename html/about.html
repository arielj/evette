<h1 align=center><u>About Evette</u></h1>

<p align=center>
Version 1.3.2 (29/11/2008)
</p>

<h2><u>To do</u></h2>


<p>
<ul>
<li>Sort out UTF-8 inconsistencies. (Waiting on a reply from Jurgis)</li>
<li>Add a base precription fee. (Waiting on feedback from forum - put in the setting but not sure on best implementation)</li>
<li>Add support for postgresql - this has turned out to be pretty complex, mysql is much more flexible when it comes to allowing evette to handle the creation and setting up of the evette database. Postgres will not allow this, it should be possible to set up evette to use postgres but much of the setup will be down to the user. I have had a tinker with this but I have a lot more to learn about postgres yet. Please let me know if this a feature that is important to you.</li>

			Dropped the splash screen. Evette took ages to start on my old laptop and I was looking for a way of letting users know that something was actually happening while it was connecting to the database but I've tried this build out at work and had problems with dialog boxes getting stuck behind the splash screen.

			Have added tools allowing users to import <a href=http://sheltermanager.sourceforge.net target=_blank>Animal Shelter Manager</a> animals and their owners. I don't imagine that anyone other than myself will find this useful so I have written it in English only and a slight adjustment has to be made to your database to define a client as "The Animal Shelter" so animals without owners can be imported. If anyone else would like to make use of this facility please let me know.<br>

			Overhauled form generation. Now users can create their own templates for invoices, client documents, animal documents and medication documents. You can now specify the expiry date of the current batch of medication on the Edit Medication panel and when prescibing medication on the vet form - this allows the medication forms generated to show the expiry date.
