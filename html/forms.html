<h1 align=center><u>Forms</u></h1>

<p>
Although the idea of a paperless practice is great. Printable output is a necessity. Evette allows you create your own custom forms which can be generated using information stored on the system. This is intended for:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
	<li>Consent Forms</li>
	<li>Vaccination Reminders</li>
	<li>Extracting information to email/fax</li>
	<li>Receipts</li>
	<li>Medication Labels</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
To use the form editor choose <b>Edit Forms</b> from the <b>Forms</b> menu. This should give you this panel:
</p>

<p align=center><img src=images/formeditor.jpg></p>

<p>
This editor uses html tags to allow you to create complex and attractive forms. If you are not familiar with html, the internet is packed with free beginners guides, putting a little time in studying html would allow you to get the most out of this tool. If you do not want to learn any html but still need to use this tool, you can simply start all of your templates with &lt;pre&gt; and end them all with &lt;/pre&gt;. They would be as attractive but they should work just fine.

<p>
The list on the left hand side of this panel shows all of templates saved on your system. You can select and edit any of them by clicking on them.
</p>

<p>
The large entry in the centre is where you type your html code. You can switch to a preview of you your template will look by clicking on the <b>Preview</b> tab.
</p>

<p>
The list of the right hand side of this panel shows the available wordkeys. If you put one of these wordkeys in your template they will be substituted for the piece of information from the database that they represent (hopefully they give away what they represent, ie. &lt;&lt;AnimalName&gt;&gt; is substituted for the name of the animal).
