<h1 align=center><u>Medication</u></h1>

<p>
This is the reason that I started writing evette. New laws mean that more detailed records are required on the movement of drugs. This program allows you to track the movement of drugs from arrival from the supplier to prescription by the vet or disposal should they become out of date or damaged.
</p>

<p>
To edit your medication, choose <b>Edit Medication</b> from the <b>Medication</b> menu. This should give you this panel:
</p>

</p>

<p>
I've made quite a few alterations to this since the first release. I have made it much faster to use but it is not quite as straight forward as it was originally.

<a name=creatingmedication><h2><b>Creating Medication</b></h2>

<p>
Before you can book any medication in or out, you must create it. So, if I want to book in 200 Fogulox 50mg tablets, first I need to tell evette that Fogulox 50mg tablets exist (assuming that someone else hasn't already done it). The left hand side of this panel list all known medications, if the medication that you are interested in is not listed. You can add it to the list by filling in the entries in the top left of the panel and clicking on the <b>Submit</b> button. Some of these entries may need be self explanatory, this is what evette expects from you:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<font color=blue size=4><b>Name:</b></font><br>
		<font color=red size=2>This seems like common sense, but it's worth bearing in mind that a lot of medications come in different concentrations, weights, volumes etc. It is a good idea to specify these details here eg. Fogulox 50mg.</font>
	</li>
	<li>
		<font color=blue size=4><b>Unit:</b></font><br>
		<font color=red size=2>Here you are expected to enter the smallest unit that this medication can be moved in. For example: a tube of eye cream will be dispensed and booked in by the tube, you are never going to buy or dispense half a tube. Typical values would be tablet, capsule, tube, bottle and for injectable medication, ml.</font>
	</li>
	<li>
		<font color=blue size=4><b>Description:</b></font><br>
		<font color=red size=2>Here you can describe the function of the medication, eg. cat antibiotic.</font>
	</li>
	<li>
		<font color=blue size=4><b>Current Batch:</b></font><br>
		<font color=red size=2>Here you can declare the current batch of the medication that you are using. When medication is moved the user is asked for its batch number, the value that you declare here will be given, but the user can change it when carrying out the movement. If you simply change this value every time you finish one batch of this medication and start another it should save your staff some valuable time.</font>
	</li>
	<li>
		<font color=blue size=4><b>Unit Price:</b></font><br>
		<font color=red size=2>The price that you enter here will be used to calculate your clients bill when the medication is dispensed.</font>
	</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<u>Note:</u><br>
If you have a medication type highlighted in the list on the left and you hit the <b>Submit</b> button you will overwrite the selected medication. This is done to save time when manipulating your medication but if you are not careful you could get in a mess. To unselect medication from the list use <b>Reset</b> button on the left.
</p>

<p>
Once a type of medication has been created, you can select it from the list on the left of the panel. Once an item has been selected from this list, the right hand side of the panel comes to life.
</p>

<p>
Using the right hand panel it is possible to book medication in from your suppliers and out. You do not need to use this tool every time you book out medication to a client, that is done automatically by the vet form, you may however need to book out damaged or out of date stock using this tool.
